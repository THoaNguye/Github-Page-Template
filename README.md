# Template for my github page

Using [template](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter/) with the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes).

See also [my personal page](https://teaplanetae.github.io/) that is built based on this template.

## Note
* Homepage: I chose /about/ as homepage. The default homepage from the [template](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter/) is a page of recent posts. To change back to this default homepage, 
    * first, change permanlink in _pages/about.md and _data/navigation.yml to /about/ (to keep /about in navbar),
    * then copy default index.htlm from [here](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) into root directory of your repository.

* Icon class: 
    * To find the right icon class of the Font Awesome icon library, search the needed icon and the corresponding class on [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/). 
    * I also added [simple-icons-font](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons-font) to use [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/). To find the right icon name, see [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) or [here](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/simple-icons@v4/icons).

* Favicon is customized in /assets/favicon/icon_creater_custom.svg. The complete package/files for favicon and html-codes are generated via [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/).
