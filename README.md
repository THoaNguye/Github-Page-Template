# Template for my github page

Using [template](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter/) with the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes).

Github page built with this template is published [at](https://thoanguye.github.io/).

## Note
* Homepage: I choose about.md as homepage. The default homepage is recent post. To change back to this default page, 
    * first, change permanlink in _pages/about.md and _data/navigation.yml to /about/ (to keep about in navbar),
    * then copy default index.htlm from [here](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) into root diractory.

* Icon class: 
    * To find the right icon class of the Font Awesome icon library, search the needed icon and the corresponding class on [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/). 
    * I also added simple icon font to use  [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/). To find the icon name, see [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) or [here](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/simple-icons@v4/icons).

* Favicon: is customized in /assets/favicon/icon_creater_custom.svg. The complete package for favicon and html-code are generated via [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/).
