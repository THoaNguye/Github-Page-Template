# My github page

Using [template](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter/) with the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes).


## To-do
* Customize size/shape and hover of profile picture
* Change style of posts in publications, talks, and posts


## Note
I choose about.md as homepage. The default homepage is recent post. To change back to this default page, 
* first, change permanlink in _pages/about.md and _data/navigation.yml to /about/ (to keep about in navbar),
* then copy default index.htlm from [here](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) into root diractory.

To find the right icon class of the Font Awesome icon library, search the needed icon and the corresponding class on [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/). I also added simple icon font to use  [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/). To find the icon name, see [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) or [here](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/simple-icons@v4/icons).
